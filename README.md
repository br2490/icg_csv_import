## Introduction

ICG CSV Import Module

ICG Main site:  https://sites.google.com/site/islandoraconsortiagroup/home

This modules provisions .csv import of metadata into a pre-existing Islandora collection creating a new fedora object with a MODS datastream for each row in the .csv file. 

## Requirements

This module requires the following modules/libraries:

* [Tuque](https://github.com/islandora/tuque)

Tuque is expected to be in one of two paths:

* sites/all/libraries/tuque (libraries directory may need to be created)
* islandora_folder/libraries/tuque

## Installation

Install it as any other Islandora Drupal module in sites/all/modules.

## Configuration

[Don't know if any Drupal configure menu will be necessary.]

## Documentation

The module assumes the first row in the .csv file are the column headers. After uploading the .csv, the user associates those headers with the correct MODS fields and attributes. The module assumes pipe-separation for multiple values per field in the .csv file. On upload, the user can select "inactive" for the status of the resulting Fedora objects.

The CSV file needs to be comma separate with quotation marks around all values. For sample CSV files see the "examples" directory. 

The CSV import form prompts for
* Content Model (all items need to use the same content model)
* Metadata schema (MODS, other may be added later)
* namespace (all items need to use the same namespace)
* file to import (the CSV file)
** If the file uploaded in not valid, it will not be ingestable.
* field-by-field mapping of the CSV file to MODS elements.
